# single_cycle_processor_system verilog



I needed basic knowledge of processor architecture and hardware design.

It was based on the professor's guidelines and his skeleton code.

I referenced "COMPUTER ORGANIAZATION AND DESIGN RISC-V EDITION"

I focused on decoding all command combinations in the risc-v instruction set. (except for sync and system call)

Verilator was used for design verification.
